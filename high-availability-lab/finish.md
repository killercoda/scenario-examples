To summarize, you saw what happens when some of the nodes are down in our three node cluster with RF=3, and with different Consistency Levels.

CL=ALL will provide higher consistency, while CL=1 will provide higher availability. 

You can read more about the Replication Factor and Consistency Levels [here](https://docs.scylladb.com/architecture/architecture-fault-tolerance/). 

In the next lesson you will take a closer look at the ScyllaDB architecture.
