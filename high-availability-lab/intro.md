This lab demonstrates, using a hands-on example, how Availability works in ScyllaDB. You’ll try setting the Replication Factor and Consistency Level in a three-node cluster and you’ll see how they affect read and write operations when all of the nodes in the cluster are up, and also when some of them are unavailable.

This lab is part of [ScyllaDB University](https://university.scylladb.com).
